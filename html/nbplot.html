<h3>Scatterplot of <br />
linguistic isolation in <br />
New Bedford, MA (2010)</h3>
<h4>
<p>This chart plots the relationship between concentrations of foreign-born residents and linguistic isolation in the city of New Bedford, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>I created this chart to provide detail that wasn't apparent on a map-based representation of this data. For example, there would be no way to tell from a map whether the percentage of foreign-born residents has a linear relationship to the percentage of linguistically-isolated residents. And that's something we might want to know.</p>
<p>Mouse over any of the colored points to view more detailed information on each Census tract. </p>
<p>(Note: linguistically isolated percentages are taken as <em>percentages of the foreign-born population</em>. They do not represent a percentage of the overall population of any Census tract.)</p>
